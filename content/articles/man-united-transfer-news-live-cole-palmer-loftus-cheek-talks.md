With several high-profile targets on their radar, the Red Devils are looking to bolster their squad ahead of the new season. In this article, we will delve into the latest transfer news surrounding Man United, including updates on Cole Palmer, Loftus-Cheek, and Nmecha.

## Transfer Targets and Rumors
Manchester United has been linked with several top players in recent weeks, and their transfer activity is expected to heat up in the coming days. One of the most exciting prospects on their radar is Cole Palmer, the highly-rated Chelsea youngster. According to reports, Man United is in talks with Chelsea over a potential transfer deal for Palmer, who has been impressing with his performances in the youth ranks.

Another player who has been linked with a move to Old Trafford is Loftus-Cheek. The England international has been struggling to establish himself in the Chelsea first team, and a transfer to Man United could be just what he needs to revive his career. While there has been no official confirmation of the talks, sources close to the player suggest that a deal could be imminent.
