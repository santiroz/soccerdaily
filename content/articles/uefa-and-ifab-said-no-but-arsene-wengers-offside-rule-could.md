Arsene Wenger, the former Arsenal manager, has proposed a new offside rule that could potentially debut before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Despite being rejected by UEFA and IFAB, Wenger's proposal has sparked a lot of interest and discussion among football fans and pundits.

## A New Era for Offside Rules
