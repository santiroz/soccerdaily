> The decision made by Donald Trump has led to a French politician questioning the USA's hosting rights for the FIFA World Cup. This controversy has sparked a debate about the suitability of the USA as a host country for the prestigious tournament.

## A Storm Brewing in the Football World
The FIFA World Cup is one of the most widely viewed and followed sporting events in the world. The tournament is held every four years, and the hosting rights are awarded to a country through a bidding process. The USA is scheduled to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Canada and Mexico. However, a recent decision made by Donald Trump has raised concerns about the country's ability to host the tournament.

The French politician, who wishes to remain anonymous, has expressed concerns about the USA's hosting rights due to the country's current political climate. The politician has cited the Trump administration's policies and actions as a reason for questioning the USA's suitability as a host country. This has sparked a debate about the impact of politics on sports and whether a country's political climate should be taken into account when awarding hosting rights.
