> The stage is set for a thrilling encounter in La Liga as Villarreal hosts Real Madrid at the Estadio de la Ceramica. Both teams have been in impressive form, with Villarreal seeking to maintain their top-four push and Real Madrid looking to keep pace with league leaders Barcelona. In this preview, we will delve into the team news, lineups, and predictions for this highly anticipated match.

## The Yellow Submarine's Quest for Champions League Football
Villarreal has been one of the surprise packages of the La Liga season, with Unai Emery's side consistently punching above their weight. The Yellow Submarine has lost just once in their last five matches, with their most recent outing being a 2-0 win over Cadiz. Emery's tactical acumen and the team's collective effort have been key to their success, and they will be looking to replicate this form against Real Madrid.

## Los Blancos' Title Aspirations
Real Madrid, on the other hand, has been in imperious form, with Carlo Ancelotti's side winning four of their last five matches. The defending champions have been in dominant mood, scoring 13 goals in their last five outings. However, they will be without the services of Karim Benzema, who is sidelined with a thigh injury. Ancelotti will be hoping that his team can cope with the absence of their star striker and still manage to secure all three points.

## Head-to-Head Record and Recent Form
The head-to-head record between Villarreal and Real Madrid is heavily skewed in favor of the visitors, with Los Blancos winning 24 of the last 35 meetings between the two sides. However, Villarreal has been in excellent form at home, with their last defeat at the Estadio de la Ceramica coming in October. The Yellow Submarine will be looking to exploit Real Madrid's vulnerability on the counter-attack and secure a vital win in their pursuit of Champions League football.
