## The Dark Side of Morocco's World Cup Bid
Morocco's bid to host the 2030 World Cup has been hailed as a historic opportunity for the country to showcase its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and world-class infrastructure.

The country's street dog population is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, with many dogs roaming the streets without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter.
